    <p class="intro">Hi, my name is Charles Turner, and I'm a year one database admin student. Welcome to my website!</p>
    
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="aboutme">As mentioned above, I'm a student studying to be a database admin, and I'm in my first year of a two year program. I more or less stumbled into this course because it had "IT" in the name, but since starting here I have found that database admin seems to suit most of the things I like to do, which is nice. Outside of school my main interests are music and games, so it is a long term goal of mine to release an indie game with an original score by me.</p>
    <h2>Some Arguably Interesting Stuff I've Done</h2>
    <div class="Portfolio">
      <img src="Assets/Splits_example.png" alt="My Splits for Portal">
      <img src="Assets/This_Site.png" alt="This Website immediately before adding this image">
      <img src="Assets/ICANTDORI.png" alt="An Emote I made for my twitch stream">
    </div>
    <p>The first of these images is an image of the splits file editor for a software called livesplits. This software is used to time a speedrun, and these splits specifically are from when I was running Portal. The second image is of this website's index file in an incomplete state. The final image is of an emote I created for my twitch stream and for others.</p>
