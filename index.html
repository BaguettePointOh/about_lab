    <p class="intro">Hi, my name is Charles Turner, and I'm a year one database admin student. Welcome to my website!</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>As mentioned above, I'm a student studying to be a database admin, and I'm in my first year of a two year program. I more or less stumbled into this course because it had "IT" in the name, but since starting here I have found that database admin seems to suit most of the things I like to do, which is nice. Outside of school my main interests are music and games, so it is a long term goal of mine to release an indie game with an original score by me.</p>
